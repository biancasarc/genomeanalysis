# IMPORTANT INFORMATION: no species for identifying the AUGUSTUS  parameter set that will arise from this BRAKER run was set. BRAKER will create an AUGUSTUS parameter set with name Sp_2. This parameter set can be used for future BRAKER/AUGUSTUS prediction runs for the same species. It is usually not necessary to retrain AUGUSTUS with novel extrinsic data if a high quality parameter set already exists.
