# Genome Analysis Projectâ€“ Paper 4
## First things first: Data Organization  
All data is organized into three main directories:  

- **`code/`**  
  Contains all scripts/code for each tool and process.  

- **`data/`**  
  Stores outcomes, statistics, and plots in formats like `.html`, `.txt`, `.csv`, and `.pdf`.  

- **`images/`**  
  Exclusively for plots in `.png` format (GitHub wiki-friendly).  
  - *Note*: R-generated plots are found only here, while other plots (for example `.pdf`) are also available in `Data/`.

# Paper: Chromosome-level genome assembly of *Niphotrichum japonicum* provides new insights into heat stress responses in mosses  

**Authors**: Xuping Zhou, Tao Peng, Yuying Zeng, Yuqing Cai, Qin Zuo, Li Zhang, Shanshan Dong, Yang Liu  

## Project Overview  
This paper presents a high-quality *de novo* chromosome-level genome assembly of the moss *Niphotrichum japonicum* to understand heat defense mechanisms induced by gene activity. Nanopore long reads combined with Hi-C scaffolding produced 14 pseudochromosomes, followed by comparative genomics. Both previously known and species-specific genes showed differential expression under 12 hours of heat stress exposure. These discoveries are crucial for understanding resilient plant responses to extreme conditions.  

In this project, I will attempt to recreate the results by:  
1. Building chromosome 3 of *Niphotrichum japonicum*  
2. Performing differential expression analysis
